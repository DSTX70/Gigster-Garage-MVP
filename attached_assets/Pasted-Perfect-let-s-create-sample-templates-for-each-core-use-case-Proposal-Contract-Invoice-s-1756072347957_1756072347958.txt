Perfect ✅ — let’s create **sample templates** for each core use case (Proposal, Contract, Invoice) so you can test the flow inside your app. I’ll structure them using the **variable system** (`{{variable_name}}`) that matches your Template Builder.

✨ These templates are **plug-and-play** — once you set up the variables in your Template Builder, users just fill them in and generate polished proposals, contracts, or invoices in seconds.

👉 Do you want me to also create a **“Test Data Set”** (sample values for each variable) so Forge and Navi can run these templates through your builder and preview the outputs right away?
